## Image manipulation using numpy


This project is about image manipulation using numpy

The image was imported using both PIL and Matplotlib

The imported image was then converted to a numpy array using asarray method

To manipulate the image, mathematical calculations were carried out on the image array

It was multiplied by an integer and an array, this changed the image resolution

TO convert the image back to jpg file. the fromarray method was used

This project shows that images are made upn of numbers, and a slight alteration of the numbers will change the image.
