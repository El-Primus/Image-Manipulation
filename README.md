# Image manipulation using numpy

This project is about image manipulation using numpy, images are commonly used to train machine learning algorithms, it is therefore important to know how to carry this out. this is ususally done using the numpy package, the algorithm must be able to distinguish images, hence the need to present an image in different formats, so that the algorithm will be able to ascertain the various ways an image might be presented



# Summary of the steps

The image was imported using both PIL and Matplotlib

The imported image was then converted to a numpy array using asarray method

To manipulate the image, mathematical calculations were carried out on the image array

It was multiplied by an integer and an array, this changed the image resolution

TO convert the image back to jpg file. the fromarray method was used

This project shows that images are made up of numbers, and a slight alteration of the numbers will change the image.
